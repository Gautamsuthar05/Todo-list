## 🧠 UX Highlights

- **Trimmed Task View**: Tasks longer than 10 words auto-trim with `"..."` and toggle on click.
- **Inline Editing**: Edit button replaces task text with input field and saves on confirmation.
- **Smart Cleanup**: "Delete All" button appears only when tasks exist and auto-removes when empty.
- **Timestamping**: Each task includes a creation timestamp for context.
